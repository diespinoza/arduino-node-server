# Design
## Mission Statement
This project aims to create a webserver that 30+ ardunio devices can communicate and be controlled through simultaneously 

## What is the problem?
Webserver that can control, direct, and bridge the flow of data and commands between a distributed arduino bot network.
### Relevant Context
- (Define circumstances. State the purpose. Define value of solution)
### Why this project?
 - Challenge myself
 - Learn full-stack
 - Create real application that microcontrollers can use
