# arduino-node-server
Server built using node. Designed for 30+ arduinos to communicate with at the same time to upload and download data to a database, and to send commands to each other.


## Description

This project aims to create a full-stack web application using nodeJS serverside, an HTML, CSS, and JS main interface. The server will allows the users to interact, view, and control their arduino. The server will store data about the connected arduinos, including any data and commands uploaded. This web application is designed for a wifi-capable Arduino to communicate with

## Getting Started

# Design
## Mission Statement
This project aims to create a webserver that 30+ ardunio devices can communicate and be controlled through simultaneously 

## What is the problem?
Webserver that can control, direct, and bridge the flow of data and commands between a distributed arduino bot network of 30+ members.
### Relevant Context
- University or highschool courses teach Internet of Things or distrubited networks or work from home
- Commercial and Industrial needs for collecting data from sensors distrubuted througout a city
- (Define circumstances. State the purpose. Define value of solution)
### Why this project?
 - Challenge myself
 - Learn full-stack
 - Create real application that microcontrollers can use
 - Application I can present on my portfolio


## Customers & Stakeholders
- Me and my robot friends
- Students
- Friends
- Future employers
### Customer & Design connection
### What challenges must be overcome
Front-end
 - Web Interface for the human user to controll their arduino
 - Web API for the ardunio client
 - Display and download of data


Back-end
 - Server behaviour
 - Coordinating  
### How does the customer interact?
 - A user to controlling their arduino bot through the web interface should be able to do so without programming and compiling code. For example, a button interface could be used instead.
 - Arduino to Ardunio communication cannot be controlled over the web interface, but it can be monitored
### What technologies and knowledge must be understoon to solve the problem?
- What is the internet?
- HTML. CSS. JS
- Arduino
- APIs
### Risks that could lead to failure
- Failure to connect to server client side
- Failure to deliver to client from server side
### Ethhica dilemas
- TODO
### Desired Result
- Acceptance tests

## Architecture
### System Overview
 - Server 
 - Human Client
 - Arduno client
### Plan
 - Build from the ground up
 - Any questions that come up, write them down and update them with the answer when resolved
 - Heavily document code to allow easy understanding and use
 - Push to git everyday
